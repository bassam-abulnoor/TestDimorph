\title{Summary statistics of baboon data collection data frame A dataset
containing summary statistics for low density lipoprotein (LDL) and
apolipoprotein B (apo B) levels in 604 baboons measured on two different
diets: a basal diet 'chow' and a high cholesterol, saturated fat diet
'pink' (HCSF). The baboons were classified into one of three subspecies
(Papio hamadryas anubis, P.h. cynocephalus, or anubistcynocephalus hybrid).
Each animal was measured on each of the two diets.}
