\usage{
MI_index(
  x,
  plot = FALSE,
  fill = "both",
  Trait = 1,
  B = NULL,
  CI = 0.95,
  p.f = 0,
  index_type = "MI",
  rand = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing summary statistics.}

\item{plot}{logical; if true a plot of densities for both sexes is returned,
Default: FALSE}

\item{fill}{Specify which sex's density to be filled with color in the plot;
either "male" in blue color, "female" in pink color or "both", Default: 'female'}

\item{Trait}{Number of the column containing names of measured parameters,
Default: 1}

\item{B}{number of bootstrap samples for generating confidence intervals. Higher
number means greater accuracy but slower execution. If NULL confidence
intervals are not produced, Default:NULL}

\item{CI}{confidence interval coverage takes value from 0 to 1, Default: 0.95.}

\item{p.f}{proportion of sample that is female (if p.f>0 then
p.m=1-p.f, where p.m is the proportion of males and bootstrap won't
be available) , Default: 0}

\item{index_type}{type of coefficient (if "MI" it fits the mixture index.
If = "NI" it fits the overlap coefficient for two normal distributions,
which is equal to 1 â€“ D_index, Default: 'MI'}

\item{rand}{logical; if TRUE, uses random seed.  If FALSE, then set.seed(42)
for repeatability, Default: TRUE}
}
\value{
returns a table of Ipina and Durand's (2010) mixture index ("MI")
for different traits with graphical representation.
}
\description{
Ipina and Durand's (2010) mixture intersection (MI) measure of
sexual dimorphism.  This measure is an overlap coefficient where the sum of
 the frequency of males and the frequency of females equals 1.0.  Ipina and
 Durand (2010) also define a normal intersection (NI) measure which is the
 overlap coefficient of two normal distributions, equivalent to Inman and
 Bradley's (1989) overlap coefficient
